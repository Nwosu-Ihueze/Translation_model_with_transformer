# Translation_model_with_transformer

Introduction:
A transformer model is an architecture used in natural language processing for transforming one sequence to another using two of its part which is the encoding and decoding.

In this article, I will be creating a transformer model that translates from English to Deutch. Deutch, otherwise known as German, according to wikipedia is a West Germanic language mainly spoken in Central Europe. It is the most widely spoken and official or co-official language in Germany, Austria, Switzerland, South Tyrol in Italy, the German-speaking Community of Belgium, and Liechtenstein. It is one of the three official languages of Luxembourg and a co-official language in the Opole Voivodeship in Poland.

Data:
The data was sourced from the European Parliament Proceedings with the corpus data covering from 1996 to 2011.

Conclusion:
I couldn't add the project folder to my repo as the corpus data was too large.
